# Experiment-14
## Program 1
### Aim: 
To study Single Inheritance
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
A class (derived class) inherits from only one base class when single inheritance is used. In this most basic type of inheritance, a child class inherits methods and attributes from a single parent class, enabling code reuse and functionality extension from the base class.
Members of the protected base class and the general public are both accessible to the derived class.
promotes class design simplicity and code reuse.

### Conclusion:
We learned about single inheritance in C++. 

## Program 2
### Aim: 
To study Multiple Inheritance. 
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from more than one base class. This makes it possible for a derived class to incorporate features from several parent classes. Despite its strength, multiple inheritance can cause complications, particularly when there are name conflicts or ambiguities and the same method or attribute appears in multiple base classes.
Two or more base classes are inherited by the derived class.
The "diamond problem," in which ambiguity results from multiple inheritance paths, may result from this.
needs to be carefully designed to keep things clear and prevent conflicts.

### Conclusion:
We learned about multiple inheritance in C++. 

## Program 3
### Aim: 
To study Multilevel Inheritance
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
A chain of inheritance is created when a class inherits from a derived class in multilevel inheritance. This indicates that one class is descended from another. A hierarchical structure can be created by each class building on the functionality of the one before it.
In a chain, classes inherit from each other.
encourages a distinct hierarchical framework.
The methods and attributes of every base class that came before it are passed down to each derived class.

### Conclusion:
We learned about multilevel inheritance in C++

## Program 4
### Aim: 
To study Hierarchical Inheritance
### Software used: 
Visual Studio Code
### Theory:
A single base class is the ancestor of several derived classes in hierarchical inheritance. This indicates that there are multiple child classes for a single parent class. In addition to the characteristics and methods that are inherited from the common base class, each derived class may have its own distinct features.
Several derived classes inherit from a single base class.
enables several subclasses to utilize the functionality of the base class.
helpful when various derived classes exhibit distinct behavior in addition to shared characteristics.

### Conclusion:
We learned about hierarchical inheritance in C++.
